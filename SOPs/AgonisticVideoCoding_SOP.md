**Materials Needed:**

- BORIS <http://www.boris.unito.it/>

- BORIS project file in google drive. Please save one with your initials
  and then upload your observations to the MASTER file at the end of
  your coding session

- Coding checklist googlesheet
  <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p-G1gczlnpwIQO6Md8zXazHMHjuFN4XqJ9tRdbMCnzI/edit?usp=sharing>

**Ethogram:**

| Activity       | Observable and performing any activity for at least 5seconds; must see at entire head of mouse                                                             |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chasing        | The actor mouse approaches the target mouse and then rapidly follows the target mouse while it rapidly flees                                               |
| Induced Flee   | The actor mouse approaches the target mouse and the target mouse rapidly flees; the actor does not follow, it keeps a constant pace of activity throughout |
| Mounting       | The actor mouse approaches the target mouse and places its forepaws on the dorsal side of the reactor mouse; this commonly leads to chasing                |
| Side Huddle    | One mouse is resting in direct body contact side-by-side at least one other mouse                                                                          |
| Mounted Huddle | One mouse is resting in direct body contact with its forepaws on the dorsal side of another mouse                                                          |

**Coding Procedure:**

- Throughout 24 hours, the behavior of all mice will be coded for the
  first 15minutes of each hour

- All video will be coded using one-zero sampling method at 1-min
  intervals

- Speed of video can be increased to up to 2.0x and jump forward can be
  increased to 5seconds

- Once major respective behaviors are displayed, you may jump to the end
  of the minute

1.  Open BORIS on the Desktop

2.  File \> Open Project \> AcomysBhv1.bcf

3.  Observation \> New Observation – Select corresponding video to code and label: cage#\_date_timevideo_initials
    
4.  Code all behaviors that occur within the 1-min interval; code the
    presence of the behaviors at the last 10 seconds of each minute

5.  Stop the video after the first 15minutes

6.  Close observation and start next one

7.  coded file will be in project, <u>save project after each coded
    video</u>

\*please code hours 0-23 in succession per day, per cage\*

**Inter- and intra-rater reliability:**

- at least 2 observations of the same video file must be completed and
  in the project file

- Inter-rater: every 5 videos; intra-rater: every 10 videos

1.  Analysis \> Interrater Reliability \> Cohen’s Kappa

2.  Select the 2 videos, click OK

3.  Select all behaviors, click OK

4.  Adjust time unit to 10 seconds, click OK

5.  Save the kappa score and number of events in the google sheet
